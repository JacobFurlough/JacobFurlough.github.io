							<h3>About Me</h3>
							<p>My focus is to create games which give players a depth of possibilities to explore while maintaining simplicity. To achieve that I have used the Unreal Engine 4 for Blueprint scripting, UI, level design, sound design, and more. My focuses are on the conceptual design and the blueprint scripting of features in games, although I work in as many areas as I can.

									<h2>Work Done in Unreal</h2>
									<p>Most of my work, outside of tutorials, in the Unreal Engine has culminated in a game called Twisted Tales. The following sections will show off my work therein.</p>

									<h2>What is Twisted Tales?</h2>
									<p>Twisted Tales is a virtual board game which incorporates RPG elements in addition to the usual minigames present in this genre.<br /><br />
									Twisted Tales has been developed by myself and one other developer. What is presented here are things that I have worked on within the project.</p>

									<h2>Overview of My Twisted Tales Work</h2>
									<p>Within Twisted Tales I have worked on nearly every part of the game including Blueprint scripting, level design, UI, 
									and pretty much everywhere else. To narrow this down a little, though, I'll focus on the areas in which I believe I have had the greatest success.</p>

						<div class="inner">
							<h2>Blueprints</h2>
							<p>This is my strongest area of expertise as I have had a hand in nearly every Blueprint in the game. Here are a few areas of the game that I have had a large role in scripting. Everything listed here has been done in the 4.15 version of the Engine.</p>
							<div class="features">
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-desktop"></span>
									<h3>Spinner</h3>
									<p>For the way numbers were rolled I wanted to preserve the feeling of a random result that still feels influenced by the player. To this end, the spinner operates fairly honestly and determines a roll based off its current rotation, after being stopped by the player, rather than by a random number generator.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-desktop"></span>
									<h3>Board Spaces</h3>
									<p>The spaces on the board, and related blueprints, provide an extraordinarily wide range of functions. Awarding items and gold, opening new levels, reviving the characters, and determining minigames and enemies are all related to spaces as well as, most notably, the movement system.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-desktop"></span>
									<h3>Minigames</h3>
									<p>Minigames showcase the variety of mechanics I have worked to employ in the game. Since each one is completely different, and bears little relation to the gameplay on the boards, each minigame has been created almost from the ground up.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-desktop"></span>
									<h3>Combat</h3>
									<p>The combat system is somewhat visually complex at first, but it serves to keep every player engaged despite being turn-based. It seeks to reduce downtime in the decision making section of a board game by having each player make their combat decisions simultaneously at the end of a round.</p>

									<h2>Main Board of Twisted Tales</h2>
									<p>In Twisted Tales the Main Board acts as the central level from which other boards are accessible. For this board, as well as the others, my role
									has been to design the layout of the spaces, determine the placement of key features such as buildings, define the boundaries of the map,
									and to make various edits to ensure a cohesive experience on the board.</p>

									<h2>Volcano Board</h2>
									<p>The Volcano was one of the more difficult levels to design due to its special feature of having 3 floors each with its own entrance and exit to the Main Board. Each level is connected by relatively short but risky paths, offering an alternative route accross the main board. This meant, however, that careful attention must be paid to the camera and the movement system of the character. Some elements of both had to be redesigned to accomodate these elements, but the verticality of this board gives it a unique feel over the others.</p>

									<h2>Pirate Camp Board</h2>
									<p>
									This was the first board designed and functions as the tutorial area for the players. Careful attention has been paid to this board's level of complexity and how features are introduced to the players. The initial few spaces offer a few safe and simple routes for players to explore the most fundamental mechanics of the game, such as movement and space types. The Pirate Camp was also designed to give choice to the players right away, allowing players to take small steps towards their preferred destinations from the get-go.</p>

							<h2>Gameplay Designs</h2>
							<p>I have also played a major role for Twisted Tales' design concepts and their proof of concepts in Blueprint. Here are a few notable cases with brief descriptions.</p>
							<div class="features">
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-cog"></span>
									<h3>Board Layouts and Space Types</h3>
									<p>Controlling how and when players encounter certain spaces, enemies, and items is crucial to the experience in a virtual board game. Given the fairly free movement on the board, crafting easily understandable boards without easy exploitation was an interesting challenge.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-cog"></span>
									<h3>Combat</h3>
									<p>Whether it was the damage formulas for attacks or the status effects of spells, creating a system simple enough to understood in minutes yet enjoyable enough to play several times throughout the course of a game was one of the most difficult tasks. This likely took the most revisions but has produced an enjoyable change of pace in the flow of gameplay.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-cog"></span>
									<h3>Minigames</h3>
									<p>In the recent years the number of party and social video games has increased, making it easier to find ideas for minigames. Fitting the themes of Twisted Tales and introducing unique but non-disruptive changes were the difficult parts.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-cog"></span>
									<h3>Equipment and Items</h3>
									<p>Balancing the effects and progression of equipment and items has been one of the simpler tasks for me. Equipment and items were designed to give players clearer goals for progression and to expand their available options in a turn.</p>
