									<h2>Work Done in Unreal</h2>

									<h2>What is Twisted Tales?</h2>
									<p>Twisted Tales is a virtual board game which incorporates RPG elements in addition to the usual minigames present in this genre.<br /><br />
									Twisted Tales has been developed by myself and one other developer. What is presented here are things that I have worked and developed on within the project.</p>

									<h2>Overview of My Twisted Tales Work</h2>
									<p>Within Twisted Tales I have done work on nearly every part of the game including Blueprint scripting, level designs, gameplay design, UI, 
									and even sound design.<br />To narrow this down a little, though, I'll focus on the areas in which I believe I had the greatest success and learned the most.</p>

							<h2>Blueprints</h2>
							<p>This is my strongest area of expertise as I have had a hand in nearly every Blueprint in the game. Here are a few showcases of Blueprints that I have had a large role in developing. Everything listed here has been done in the 4.15 version of the Engine.</p>

									<h3>Spinner</h3>
									<p>For the way numbers were rolled I wanted to preserve the feeling of a random result that still feels influenced by the player. To this end, the spinner operates fairly honestly and determines the roll based off its rotation, stopped by the player, rather than by a random number generator and matching that result visually afterwards.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-cog"></span>
									<h3>Board Spaces</h3>
									<p>The spaces on the board, and related blueprints, provide an extraordinarily wide range of functions. Awarding items and gold, opening new levels, reviving the characters, and determining minigames and enemies are all related to the spaces as well as, most notably, the movement system.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-desktop"></span>
									<h3>Minigames</h3>
									<p>The minigames showcase the variety of mechanics I have worked to employ in the game. Since each one is completely different, and bears little relation to the gameplay on the boards, each minigame has been created almost from the ground up. There are several minigames, and while I had a role in developing each of them, the ones I had the lead role in are shown here.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-link"></span>
									<h3>Combat</h3>
									<p>The combat system is the greatest example of group work in the project. Between the options each player has, the AI for both computer players and enemies, the unique UI elements, and base elements of the combat system itself the combat system is likely the most complex series of blueprints in the game. It seeks to reduce downtime in the decision making section of a board game by having each player make their combat decisions simultaneously at the end of a round.</p>

									<h2>Main Board of Twisted Tales</h2>
									<p>In Twisted Tales one board serves as the centerpiece from which all the other sections of the board may be accessed.
									This is known as the "Main Board" and is the most carefully designed map. My role in each of these boards, including this one,
									has been to design the layout of the spaces, determine the placement of buildings and other key features, define the boundaries of the map,
									and to make various edits to ensure a cohesive experience on the board both visually and in gameplay.</p>

									<h2>Volcano Board</h2>
									<p>The Volcano was one of the more difficult levels to design due to its special feature of having 3 different entrances each at different heights.
									Each level is connected by relatively short but risky paths, offering an alternative route accross the main board. This meant, however, that
									careful attention must be paid to the camera and the movement system of the character. Some elements of both had to be redesigned to accomodate
									these elements, but the verticality of this board gives it a unique feel over the others.</p>

									<h2>Pirate Camp Board</h2>
									<p>This was the first board designed and functions as the tutorial area for the players. Careful attention has been paid to the board's level of complexity and the order in which the spaces are introduced to the players. The initial few spaces offer a few safe and simple routes for the players to explore the most fundamental mechanics of the game, such as movement and space types. The Pirate Camp was simultaneously designed to give choice to the players right away, allowing experienced players to take small steps towards their preferred destinations. This enables veteran and new players to have an enjoyable experience, even playing side-by-side, without burdening either with slow tutorial content or a lack of direction.</p>
